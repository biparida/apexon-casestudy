# Components of a Well-Built Pipeline

1. Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)
Continuous integration and continuous delivery allow for seamless implementation of changes to the project and delivery of those changes for further testing before moving to the next stage.

2. Continuous Testing/Continuous Deployment (CT/CD)
Continuous testing and continuous deployment are for testing the changes delivered and ensuring they do not cause issues or conflicts before deployment to the production environment.

3. Continuous Monitoring
Continuous monitoring is done to help ensure that the project is safe and secure, meets compliance requirements, tracks errors, and much more. This aids in the entire process but centers on the security of the project.

4. Continuous Feedback
Continuous feedback is precisely what it sounds like. This is where you get end-users' feedback on the project's impact and their interpretation/impression. This feedback is vital for improving the project and fixing bugs or errors.

5. Continuous Operations
This stage is for limiting planned downtime and preventing unplanned downtime. Operations will take steps to avoid issues and set up a plan of attack that leaves the project running, which helps maintain the pipeline flow — a very important step.

6. Tools and Control Environment
Researching tools and your preferred control environment for your DevOps pipeline is one of the most critical steps. These tools will effectively structure the rest of your DevOps process and workflow.

There are a lot of tools out there for the DevOps pipeline, and not every tool will meet your needs. Therefore, knowing which ones do and are compatible with each other is very important.

7. Build Server and Automation
The next step is to get your build server running to host your project and set up your security and data storage. This stage is also a prime opportunity to configure your automation technology and test it out in your new build server.

8. DevOps Pipeline Deployment
At this point, you should have everything set up and ready to go. The only thing left is deploying your DevOps pipeline and reaping the benefits.

## How to Build a DevOps pipeline

Step 1: Choose CI/CD Tool
Although DevOps methodologies might differ from company to company, each company must pick a CI/CD tool that suits its specific needs.

The most common examples of these CI/CD tools are Jenkins, GitLab, Bamboo, TeamCity, and CirlceCi. Each tool has specific features and properties to help teams choose the best fit.

Step 2: Establish a Control Environment
Whether your development team is small or not, you need a central location or place - known as a control environment — to store your source code.

This control environment allows multiple developers to work together on the same codebase, avoid merge conflicts, and be on the same page regarding any changes made to your code.

Excellent examples of source control management tools include Git, GitLab, and BitBucket.

Step 3: Set up a build server
A build server or continuous integration (CI) server offers developers a centralized and reliable environment to build distributed development projects.

Without a build server, it would be difficult to determine if the code works and is ready for production.

Step 4. Initiate Automated Tests
After setting up your code on the build server, the next step is to test it.

You can run automated unit, regression, functional, and integration tests, ensuring your code is error-free as you move on to the deployment stage.

Step 5: Deploy to Production
Here at the final stage, you can choose to deploy your code either manually or automatically.

Deploying manually first is often recommended because you’d be able to monitor and quickly flag any issues that might come up. If no issues rears its head, you can then automatically deploy the code to save time and effort.

You need a server infrastructure if you’re deploying your code manually or automatically. The server infrastructure you use usually depends on the function you want it to perform and the type of software you want to deploy.

## The Output of a DevOps Pipeline
The DevOps pipeline is an iterative and largely automated process by design. In this vein, it utilizes variables to help maintain its various interdependent states to create the final project.

The DevOps Pipeline has many tasks in its stages, and for each task, a variable is created to store and share data across the pipeline — such as permissions, users, and more. Sharing data through the pipeline makes for a robust lifecycle capable of scaling and adapting as needed.

DevOps Pipeline Example
The best way to think of the DevOps pipeline is to imagine an assembly line for your project. At each assembly line step, things are added, removed, and tested to ensure a quality product.
